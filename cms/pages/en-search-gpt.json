I've been advocating for indexing and positioning in Bing for years, and I think in 2024, the potential of this search engine is clearly visible.\n\nIf you don't want to miss this new opportunity and want to stay ahead of your competitors, I recommend using Foudroyer to position yourself today for what might be the future of SEO."
